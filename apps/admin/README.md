# Admin

The Admin application allows admins to manage the Public and Back Office apps.

It allows an admin to...

- ... change the texts of the main form,
- ... build surveys for additional questions,
- ... create categories and assign these categories to surveys,
- ... create and change e-mail templates.

## Getting started

Run `npm run serve:admin` in the root directory to start the Admin app.
