# Error handling

## Melding form

Most pages in the Melding form follow a common error handling strategy.
There are a few exceptions, which are detailed below.

### Common error handling strategy

- For errors occurring during page load, we show a general error page (`src/app/(general)/error.tsx` and `src/app/(map)/locatie/kies/error.tsx`).
  An error can be a server error, or a 4XX or 5XX response from the back end.
  These error pages are catch-all, so any error not specifically addressed will end up here.
- On page load for all pages except the first, we verify if the required session cookies (an `id` and `token`) are present.
  If they are absent, we redirect to the first page.
- When performing an action, an error may occur.
  This can be a server error, or a 4XX or 5XX response from the back end.
  In such cases, we display the current page with an [Alert](https://designsystem.amsterdam/?path=/docs/components-feedback-alert--docs) at the top of the `main` container.
- Form validation is also done by the back end.
  If a user’s responses fail validation, the back end returns an error.
  We handle those errors differently from others; refer to [the forms documentation](./0007-forms.md) for further details.
- If session tokens are missing when executing an action, we redirect to `/cookie-storing`.
  From there, a user can start the form flow again.
  Directly redirecting to the first page would be too abrupt, hence the intermediate page.
- When a user navigates to a path that does not exist, we show a `not-found` page.

### Exceptions

#### Map page

The map page (`/locatie/kies`) handles errors in a slightly different manner.
At the time of writing, we do not know how exactly.
When we do, we will update this section.

#### Attachments

The attachments page (`/bijlage`) also handles errors in a slightly different manner.
At the time of writing, we do not know how exactly.
When we do, we will update this section.
