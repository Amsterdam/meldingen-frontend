# Progressive enhancement

Our Melding Form application uses a progressive enhancement approach.
This means that users can create a _melding_ even if they don't have JavaScript or CSS available.
When CSS is available, this process is more visually appealing.
With JavaScript available, additional features are provided.
This approach ensures that the application remains functional even if CSS fails to load or JavaScript is temporarily disabled, making it more reliable.
