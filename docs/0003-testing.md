# Testing

## Unit tests

To ensure the quality of our code, we write unit tests for our React components.
For the components in our libraries (`/libs`) we use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
For the components in our applications (`/apps`) we use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) with React Testing Library.

The reason for this difference is simply that Nx, our monorepo tool, automatically sets it up this way.
We currently don’t have any reason to change it, seeing as the syntax for Jest and Vitest is largely the same.
If this causes issues in the future, we might reconsider this choice.

### Code conventions

We aim to have a unit test for all React components. A unit test should test functionality, not implementation details.
In other words, it should test a component the same way a user would use it.

For that reason, we avoid using test ids (which is something a user can’t / won’t use),
and instead find elements by their accessible name.

React Testing Library has nice [documentation on how to find elements](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority),
where they prioritize the queries you can use.
