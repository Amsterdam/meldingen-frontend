# Forms

Meldingen revolves for a large part around forms.
Our Admin app allows admins to create and update forms, which are shown in our Public and Backoffice apps.

To make dealing with forms easier, we use [Form.io](https://form.io/).
Form.io allows us to easily build forms, using the included [Builder](https://help.form.io/developers/form-development/form-builder),
and render and validate them on the client side, using the included [Renderer](https://help.form.io/developers/form-development/form-renderer).

Form.io uses a relatively simple JSON schema, which our back-end can also use.
