# Meldingen front-end

Hi and welcome to the Meldingen front-end repository!

This monorepo houses three separate front-ends:

- Backoffice: where professionals can handle these reports.
- Admin: where admins can manage the Public and Backoffice apps.

[Read the docs](./docs/README.md) for more information on the project architecture and plug-in choices.
